**Picker Date**

This app uses a special picker view that's designed to work with dates.

Features:
- does not need a data source or delegate.
- can be configured in the Attributes Inspector

If you need access to it from the source code, you can connect it to an outlet.

You are probably interested in the "value changed" event, so that you can do something with the selected date.

This app also begins to teach you about date and time in Cocoa. See the Utility class. Also, you learn how to format NSDate objects.
